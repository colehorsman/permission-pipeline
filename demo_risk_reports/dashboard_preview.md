## 🚨 Critical Findings

### admin-user (HIGH Risk - 74.8/100)
```
🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES:
• Privilege Escalation (100.0): Found 4 dangerous actions, 3 unrestricted
• MFA Disabled (100.0): Console access enabled but no MFA devices
• Policy Violations (80.0): Found 5 violations, 2 high severity

🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Enable MFA for console access
2. Restrict privilege escalation actions with conditions  
3. Review and remediate policy violations
4. Replace wildcard permissions with specific actions
```

### cross-account-service-role (MEDIUM Risk - 51.4/100)
```
🟠 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:
• Policy Violations (90.0): Found 6 violations, 3 high severity
• Excessive Permissions (100.0): 200% wildcard usage ratio
• External Access (60.0): Cross-account access from 1 external account

🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Review and remediate policy violations

## 💡 Organizational Recommendations

### 🚨 URGENT (Complete within 24 hours)
- **Review admin-user immediately** - Critical privilege escalation risks
- **Enable MFA** for all console users
- **Audit privilege escalation permissions** across all identities

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY (Complete within 1 week)  
- **Replace wildcard permissions** - 75% of identities affected
- **Review unused access** - Remove permissions for unused services
- **Cross-account access review** - Validate external account trust

### 📋 ROUTINE IMPROVEMENTS
- **Implement least privilege** access patterns
- **Regular credential rotation** for access keys
- **Automated policy compliance** checking

## 📈 Compliance Status

### Framework Violations Detected
```
🔴 SOC2:     Admin access without MFA
🟠 PCI-DSS:  Wildcard permissions detected  
🟡 GDPR:     Some stale access beyond retention
```

### Security Maturity Assessment
```
Current Level:  ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5 - Developing)
Target Level:   ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5 - Managed)

Key Gaps:
• MFA enforcement
• Least privilege implementation  
• Regular access reviews
```
