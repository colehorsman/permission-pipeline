📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   AWS Account: 123456789012
   Assessment Date: 2025-06-14T21:54:38.597795
   
   Overall Security Posture: 🟠 ELEVATED RISK
   Average Risk Score: 58.7/100
   
🎯 KEY FINDINGS
   Total IAM Identities: 25
   High-Risk Identities: 11 (44.0%)
   
   Risk Distribution:
   • Critical Risk: 3 identities
   • High Risk: 8 identities
   • Medium Risk: 10 identities
   • Low Risk: 4 identities

💼 BUSINESS IMPACT
   Risk Level: CRITICAL - Significant exposure to security incidents
   
   Potential Consequences:
   • Data breach exposure
   • Compliance violations
   • Operational disruption
   • Reputational damage
   
   Financial Impact Estimate:
   • Immediate remediation cost: $165,000
   • Potential breach cost: $2,641,500

⏰ EXECUTIVE ACTION REQUIRED
   Priority: EXECUTIVE OVERSIGHT RECOMMENDED
   Timeline: 1-2 weeks
   
   Board Oversight Needed:
   
   • Quarterly security updates to board

   4. Risk Management: Include in standard risk reporting

📈 TREND ANALYSIS
   Current Risk Trajectory: Stable
   
   Key Metrics to Monitor:
   • High-risk identity count (target: <5% of total)
   • Average risk score (target: <30)
   • Time to remediation (target: <48 hours for critical)
   • Repeat findings (target: <10%)

💡 NEXT STEPS
   Immediate (24-48 hours):
   • Executive briefing on critical findings
   • Resource allocation for remediation
   • Communication plan for stakeholders
   
   Short-term (1-4 weeks):
   • Implementation of security improvements
   • Enhanced monitoring and alerting
   • Staff training and awareness
   
   Long-term (1-6 months):
   • Security architecture review
   • Compliance framework updates
   • Third-party security assessment
